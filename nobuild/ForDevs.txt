Welcome to the dev team! We are happy to have you here!
EZ is a new language that is build entirely in C++, is interpreted, and has everything from output to data structures.
Note that we edit the EZ language on a website called codeanywhere.com, of which you may have heard of.
If you want to join us in editing today, go ahead and email realezlang@gmail.com
You will need an account to edit on Codeanywhere. Getting an account is simple and requires an email account.
We have given a set of commands to make your life easier:

Helper = What it does
---------------------
runOut = Compiles and runs the program for a Mac/Linux environment for 32 bit (which will also run on 64 bit).
runWin = Compiles and runs the program in a windows environment for 32 bit (which will also run on 64 bit).
debugr = Compiles and runs gdb for the program, of which you can run line by line. Type this into a terminal for more on debugging: man gdb
runWeb = Compiles and runs the program for our website version (of which isn't too different from the linux version).
updatr = Updates the system that our server is on. Simply grabs updates and installs them.

Note that you must be on the list of contributors in order to commit to git.
If you are not on that list, simply request access by emailing realezlang@gmail.com

Now for the commands to the aliases above:
alias runOut='cd ~/workspace/source/; g++ EZ.cpp -m32 -std=c++11 -o ez.out; ./ez.out example.ez'
alias debugr='cd ~/workspace/source/; g++ EZ.cpp -g -std=c++11 -m32 -o bugs.out; gdb bugs.out; echo "Are you done debugging?"; read y_or_n; while [ "$y_or_n" != "y" ]; do gdb bugs.out; echo "Are you done debugging?"; read y_or_n; done; if [ "$y_or_n" == "y" ]; then rm -rf bugs.out; fi'
alias runWin='cd ~/workspace/source/; i686-w64-mingw32-g++ EZ.cpp -std=c++11 -o ez.exe -static; wineconsole --backend=curses "ez.exe" "example.ez"'
alias runWeb='cd ~/workspace/source/; g++ web.cpp -std=c++11 -o ez_web.out; echo "show hello world!" > web.ez; ./ez_web.out web.ez'
alias updatr="sudo -- sh -c 'apt-get update; apt-get upgrade -y; apt-get dist-upgrade -y; apt-get autoremove -y; apt-get autoclean -y; if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then echo \"Restart required for updates to go through.\"; read -n1 -p \"Restart the computer? [y,n]: \" y_or_n; if [ \"$y_or_n\" == \"y\" ]; then printf \"\n\"; sudo shutdown -r; else printf \"\n\"; echo \"Restart declined.\"; fi; fi'"
