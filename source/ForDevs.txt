Welcome to the dev team! We are happy to have you here!
EZ is a new language that is build entirely in C++, is interpreted, and has everything from output to data structures.
Note that we edit the EZ language on a website called codeanywhere.com, of which you may have heard of.
If you want to join us in editing today, go ahead and email realezlang@gmail.com
You will need an account to edit on Codeanywhere. Getting an account is simple and requires an email account.
We have given a set of commands to make your life easier:

Helper = What it does
---------------------
runOut = Compiles and runs the program for a Mac/Linux environment for 32 bit (which will also run on 64 bit).
runWin = Compiles and runs the program in a windows environment for 32 bit (which will also run on 64 bit).
debugr = Compiles and runs gdb for the program, of which you can run line by line. Type this into a terminal for more on debugging: man gdb
runWeb = Compiles and runs the program for our website version (of which isn't too different from the linux version).
updatr = Updates the system that our server is on. Simply grabs updates and installs them.
cmpltr = Compiles every version of the program, then copies those finished files to the upload folder. Afterwards, runs the commands in updatr.
